\item It is highly recommended that \href{https://github.com/samtools/samtools}{\tt samtools} also be installed alongside i\+Var. i\+Var uses the output of samtools mpileup to call variants and generate consensus sequences. In addition, samtools {\ttfamily sort} and {\ttfamily index} commands are very useful to setup a pipeline using i\+Var.
